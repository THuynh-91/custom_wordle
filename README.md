## Overview

AI Wordle Duel is a full-stack TypeScript application that extends the classic Wordle concept with intelligent AI opponents. The project features multiple game modes, variable word lengths (3-7 letters). Built with React, Node.js, and Express, the application provides a seamless gaming experience with real-time state management and responsive design.

## Features

### Game Modes

#### 1. Today's Wordle
Watch the AI solve the official daily Wordle puzzle. The AI demonstrates its solving strategy on the same 5-letter word everyone else is playing.

#### 2. Challenge AI
Submit your own custom word (3-7 letters) and watch the AI attempt to solve it. After the AI completes the puzzle, you can immediately challenge it with another word through the replay interface, allowing for rapid successive challenges.

#### 3. Race Mode
Compete head-to-head against the AI on the same secret word. Both players see the same puzzle and race to solve it first. Features include:
- Real-time turn indicators showing whose turn is active
- Live scoreboard tracking wins, losses, and ties
- Game-ending modal displaying the secret word and current score
- Instant replay functionality to start a new race with a different word

#### 4. Human Play
Classic Wordle gameplay where you try to guess the secret word in 6 attempts or fewer.
