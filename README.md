# AI Wordle Duel

A sophisticated Wordle-style duel game where players can challenge AI solvers, race against them, or watch AI-vs-AI matches. Supports variable word lengths from 3 to 7 letters with multiple AI strategies including entropy-based solvers and machine learning policies.

## Features

- **Variable Word Lengths**: Play with 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7-letter words
- **Multiple Game Modes**:
  - Custom Challenge: Submit a secret word and watch the AI solve it
  - Human Play: Classic Wordle gameplay with AI hints
  - Race Mode: Compete against AI on the same secret word
  - AI vs AI: Watch different AI strategies compete
- **Advanced AI Solvers**:
  - Frequency-based heuristic solver
  - Entropy/Information-gain solver
  - Supervised ML policy (trained on expert trajectories)
  - Optional RL fine-tuned policy
- **AI Explanation Panel**: See the AI's reasoning, top candidates, and expected information gain
- **Hard Mode**: Discovered letters must be used in subsequent guesses
- **Shareable Challenges**: Generate challenge links with specific seeds or custom secrets
- **Leaderboards**: Track performance across different word lengths and game modes

## Game Rules

- Players have 6 attempts to guess the secret word
- After each guess, tiles show feedback:
  - ðŸŸ© **Green**: Correct letter in correct position
  - ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow**: Correct letter in wrong position
  - â¬œ **Gray**: Letter not in the word
- Duplicate letters are handled correctly (greens take priority, then yellows)
- In Hard Mode, revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses

## AI Solvers

### Frequency Solver
Uses letter frequency analysis and positional statistics to make educated guesses. Fast and effective for shorter words.

### Entropy Solver
Calculates expected information gain for each possible guess, selecting the one that maximally reduces the candidate set. More computationally intensive but highly effective.

### ML Policy
Trained on expert trajectories from the entropy solver. Learns to balance information gain with likelihood of being the answer. Supports both per-length and unified models.

### RL Policy (Optional)
Fine-tuned using reinforcement learning (PPO) to optimize guess efficiency. Uses masked action spaces to ensure valid guesses.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/game/create` - Create a new game
- `POST /api/game/:gameId/guess` - Submit a guess
- `GET /api/game/:gameId/ai-move` - Get AI's next move
- `POST /api/game/:gameId/validate` - Validate a word
- `GET /api/leaderboard/:length` - Get leaderboard for word length
- `GET /api/words/random/:length` - Get random word

## ML Training

To train the ML policy:

1. Generate expert trajectories:
```bash
npm run generate-trajectories
```

2. Train the model:
```bash
cd ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_policy.py --length 5 --epochs 50
```

3. The trained model will be saved to `ml/models/`

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode
```
